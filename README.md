# MAC0214 - Extracurricular Activities 2024.2
Repository for the USP course 'MAC0214 - Extracurricular Activities', taken during the second semester of 2024.

The main goal is to develop competitive programming skills and compete in multiple tournaments, including the SBC Programming Marathon, the most important competition in Brazil. I intend to participate in all possible contests over the next couple of years.

All code will be developed in C++. The 'default.cpp' file, containing the necessary definitions, was imported from UFMG's competitive programming group.

I have also used their book to guide my studies.

Here is a list of the studied topics:
  - 2-Pointers
  - BFS and Dijkstra
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Line Sweep
  - Geometry
  - LCA
  - Greedy
  - STL
  - DFS
  - UnionFind
  - Combinatorics

The supervisor of this project is Enrique Junchaya, our coach from the MaratonUSP group. The report will be written in Portuguese as required by the university.
